        This package provides an implementation of the GDA adaptor with various sample services.
        <P>
            The purpose of this package is to demonstrate how a GDA adaptor implementation can be developed.
            It depends on the basedriver.tutorial OSGi bundle that discovers pseudo devices and gives them to the adaptor.
            Please be aware that the pseudo devices discovered by the basedriver is independent from the GDA.
            The adaptor wraps them up in GDA devices so that they can enjoy the various features provided by the GDA.
