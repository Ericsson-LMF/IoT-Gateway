        When a GDA protocol adaptor implements a GenericDevice object which represents a device, it is supposed to extend an SPI class which implements GenericDevice interface.
        <p>
            This is done by subclassing the SchemaBasedGenericDevice provided in generic.access.spi. One then implement services by subclassing the generated service base base classes, also provided in generic.access.spi.
            The SPI base classes implements logics which are needed in common. One such logic is security enforcement.
