Todos
- udp message queue for incoming messages (not sure if such would be needed?)!
- package ordering not handled
- RST message
- database to cache messages?
- stack is no way finished/tested yet, basic functionality towards jcoap working
- matching request is not really tested yet, needs more testing towards jcoap & unit tests..

Functionality from different drafts
- block-wise transfer: support for block1 is not implemented yet. 

- Link format: resource discovery done using the DISCOVERY_INTERVAL, DISCOVERY_ADDRESS and DISCOVERY_PORT properties in coap.properties. 
A basic string tokenizer is used for parsing, good enough for now. Needs improvements (a fast fix done for CDC 1.1.2)

- error handling tbd! it should be studied how other osgi bundles are handling it
- if observation framework requires that gw is able to handle requests, how to respond ? Do we need anything from the local services etc..
