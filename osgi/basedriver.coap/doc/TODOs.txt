Todos
- udp message queue -> DONE for sending, but not for incoming messages (not sure if such would be needed?)!
- package ordering not handled
- RST message
- database to cache messages?
- stack is no way finished/tested yet, basic functionality towards jcoap working
- matching request is not really tested yet, needs more testing towards jcoap & unit tests..

- caching of "normal" requests - OK. Use max-age option default value or max-age option value in the message to cache e.g. responses. 

Functionality from different drafts
- block-wise transfer: basic block2 ok against californium stack. support for block1 is not implemented yet. 

Observe: The gateway keeps the observation relationship active until all the listeners have stopped listening. - OK

Congestion control: One active interaction towards a CoAP server (defined in the core draft 08) - OK (server replies server busy)

Configuration: configuration from a properties file  - OK

Link format: resource discovery done using the DISCOVERY_INTERVAL, DISCOVERY_ADDRESS and DISCOVERY_PORT properties in coap.properties. 
A basic string tokenizer is used for parsing, good enough for now. Needs improvements (a fast fix done for CDC 1.1.2) - OK
